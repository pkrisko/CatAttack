Linked below and attached is a Java 2D game called "CatAttack" produced by a 
small team of developers as a passion project. This game has its own custom 
engine, handler, particle system, buffer strategy, etc. Implemented OOP 
design patterns and paradigms.

We attacked this project through an Agile development process.  Created base
requirements, use cases, and overall architecture, then moved into card-based
sprint cycles of development.
